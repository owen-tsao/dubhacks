Original Decision: "${originalDecision}"
Chosen Path: "${chosenPath}"
Simulation Results: ${JSON.stringify(simulationResult, null, 2)}

Create a detailed, specific storyline (2-3 paragraphs) showing how their life unfolds over 6-12 months after making this choice.

The storyline should be:
- HIGHLY SPECIFIC to their exact decision and choice
- Realistic and relatable with concrete details
- Show both positive and challenging aspects with specific examples
- Connect directly to the simulation results and their implications
- Set up the follow-up decisions naturally
- Include specific timeframes, emotions, and outcomes
- Be personal and engaging, not generic

Then generate 3-4 specific follow-up decisions that naturally arise from this storyline. These should be:
- Highly contextual to their specific situation and decision
- Realistic and actionable
- Different from generic categories - be specific
- Based on the storyline and simulation results
- Show different paths they could take next

Examples of specific vs generic follow-up decisions:
- SPECIFIC: "Negotiate for a 20% salary increase based on your 6-month performance review" vs GENERIC: "Continue Current Path"
- SPECIFIC: "Start couples therapy to address the communication issues that emerged" vs GENERIC: "Pivot Strategy"
- SPECIFIC: "Apply for the senior developer position that opened up in your team" vs GENERIC: "Explore New Opportunities"

The user has shared this decision:
Title: "${decisionTitle}"

Your task is to determine if this decision has enough specific details to create a meaningful, realistic simulation of the different choice paths. Consider:

1. **Specificity**: Are the options clearly defined and specific enough?
2. **Context**: Is there enough background information about the user's situation?
3. **Constraints**: Are important factors like timeline, budget, location, etc. mentioned?
4. **Stakes**: Is it clear what the consequences of each choice might be?
5. **Simulation Quality**: Could you realistically simulate what life would be like 1 year after each choice?

Examples of decisions that NEED clarification:
- "Should I go to UW or Purdue?" (missing: major, financial situation, career goals, location preferences)
- "Should I take the job offer?" (missing: current job details, salary, location, company culture)
- "Should I move to a new city?" (missing: which city, current situation, reasons for moving)
- "Should I start a business?" (missing: what type of business, current financial situation, experience)

Examples of decisions that DON'T need clarification:
- "Should I take the $120k software engineer job at Google in Seattle or the $100k job at Microsoft in Redmond?" (very specific)
- "Should I major in Computer Science at UW or Electrical Engineering at Purdue, given that I want to work in tech and both schools offer similar programs?" (specific with context)

Title: "${decisionTitle}"

Based on the decision title and description, generate 3-5 specific, thoughtful clarifying questions that would help create a realistic simulation of each choice path. Focus on gathering information that would be essential for simulating what life would be like 1 year after making each choice.

The questions should help uncover:
- **Specific details** about each option (majors, salaries, locations, timelines, etc.)
- **Personal context** (current situation, goals, constraints, preferences)
- **Important factors** that would affect the simulation (financial situation, family considerations, career aspirations)
- **Missing information** needed to realistically compare the options

Examples of good clarifying questions:
- "What major did you get into each school for?" (for college decisions)
- "What's the salary difference between the two job offers?" (for career decisions)
- "What's your current financial situation and how would this decision affect it?" (for financial decisions)
- "What are your main priorities - career growth, work-life balance, or financial stability?" (for general decisions)

- Specific and actionable
- Focused on simulation-relevant details
